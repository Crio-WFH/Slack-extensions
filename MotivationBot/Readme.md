## MotivatorBot [ UNDER REVIEW ]

### A simple bot which pushes you forward to do more with the help of alerts, reminders, schedulers, and Github, Google Calendar Integrations.

- How many times do we miss or get late on checking Github issues, mentions, or branch alerts. No more now, using Pipedream API to integrate Github, now one can directly get notified when they are mentioned, or a branch is created, or issue is raised for a repo.  

- Have you dozed off with naptime while a calendar event was scheduled for next one hour and so you missed it ? Say no further, you can now get alerts if there's a meeting in an hour with help of Pipedream integration and some JS snippets.

- Want to quick search your favorite github repo stats, or get issue counts, no need to open chrome. Just **/searchrepo** it. 

- In order to stay on track and to not miss out anything, one can set reminds for himself or for channel with precision of minutes or hours or days. Just **remindme** or **remindus** it

- Want to set scheduled messages with a friendly precision, you got it. Just **schedule** it

- Often during work all we feel is a need to find some positivity to deal with anxiety, stress or fear or even imposter syndrome. Sometimes words are the best friend we need. This bot posts a good morning alert, advice at noon, and quotes in evening. 

- Written solely on Javascript
